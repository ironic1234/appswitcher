# Mofi (MacOS Rofi)

Rust backend and Svelte frontend with tauri (probably should have done this with pure rust, that's next)

### Coming (Hopefully)
- Pure Rust
- Support for other system apps (Mostly finder)
- Other features (translations, calculator, maybe files)
- Customization (colors, not sure how to do with tauri but with pure rust should be doable)
